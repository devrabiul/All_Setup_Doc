### Manual Download of Gradle Distribution and Verify Gradle Configuration

#### Estimated Download Size
The size of the Gradle distribution file (gradle-7.6.3-all.zip) can vary, but typically, the -all distribution (which includes sources, docs, and binaries) is around 100-150 MB.

#### Steps to Resolve the Issue
Manual Download of Gradle Distribution:

Download the required Gradle distribution manually from the Gradle Distributions page.
Place the downloaded zip file into the Gradle wrapper directory of your project.

#### Verify Gradle Configuration:

Ensure your gradle-wrapper.properties file is configured correctly to point to the local file.

Manual Download and Configuration
1. Download Gradle
Go to the Gradle Distributions page.
Download gradle-7.6.3-all.zip.
2. Place the Gradle Zip File
Navigate to your project's Gradle wrapper directory: your_project/android/gradle/wrapper/.
Create a directory if it doesn't exist: your_project/android/gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-7.6.3-all/.
Move the downloaded gradle-7.6.3-all.zip file to this directory.
3. Update gradle-wrapper.properties

Ensure your gradle-wrapper.properties file points to the correct location. It should look something like this:

#### Properties

```bash
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4G
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true

distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=file:///opt/lampp/htdocs/flutter/shoply/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-8.8-all/gradle-8.8-all.zip
```

Verify the Path
Ensure the path /opt/lampp/htdocs/flutter/shoply/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-8.8-all/gradle-8.8-all.zip is correct and the file exists in that location.

#### Clean and Rebuild
After updating the gradle-wrapper.properties file, follow these steps to clean and rebuild your project:

Clean the Project:

```bash
flutter clean
```

Get Dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Run the Project:

```bash
flutter run
```

### Additional Considerations

#### File Permissions: 
Ensure that the Gradle zip file has the correct permissions and is readable by the user running the build.
Correct Version: Verify that the version of the Gradle distribution (in this case, 8.8) is compatible with your Flutter project.

By following these steps, you should be able to configure your project to use the local Gradle distribution file and resolve the timeout issue during the Gradle build process.
