To get your device's SSH key, you typically need to generate one if it doesn't already exist. Here's how you can do that:

For Linux or macOS:
Open Terminal.

Generate a new SSH key (if you don't have one):

Run the following command:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

You'll be prompted to choose a file location to save the key. Press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).
You'll be asked to enter a passphrase. You can choose to leave it empty or enter a passphrase for added security.
View your SSH key:

To display the public key, run:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

To display the private key (you should never share this with others), run:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

For Windows (Using Git Bash or WSL):
Open Git Bash or WSL Terminal.

Generate a new SSH key (if you don't have one):

Run the following command:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Press Enter to accept the default file location (/c/Users/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa for Git Bash or /home/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa for WSL).
You can set a passphrase if desired.
View your SSH key:

Run:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Adding SSH Key to SSH-Agent (Optional):
To automatically manage your SSH keys, you can add them to the SSH agent.

Start the SSH agent:
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Add your SSH key to the agent:
```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Copying SSH Key to Clipboard:
To easily copy your SSH key to the clipboard (e.g., for adding it to GitHub, GitLab, etc.):

Linux/Mac:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy
```

Windows (Git Bash):
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip
```

After completing these steps, your SSH key will be ready to use.
