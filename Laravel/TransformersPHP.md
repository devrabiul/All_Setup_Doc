# TransformersPHP

To integrate TransformersPHP for machine learning capabilities in your Laravel project, you can follow these steps:

### Installation
Check if TransformersPHP is available via Composer. If so, you can install it:

```bash
composer require transformersphp/transformers
```

If the library is not on Packagist, you may need to manually include it in your project or follow specific installation instructions from the repository.

### Setup
Publish Configurations (if available): If the package includes configuration files, publish them:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="TransformersPHP\TransformersServiceProvider"
```
API Integration: TransformersPHP likely relies on an API to access machine learning models. Obtain an API key or credentials from their service provider.

Environment Variables: Add necessary credentials to your .env file:

```env
TRANSFORMERS_API_KEY=your_api_key
TRANSFORMERS_BASE_URL=https://api.transformersphp.com
```

Using Transformers in Your Code: Example: Performing text summarization.

```php
use TransformersPHP\Client;

$client = new Client(env('TRANSFORMERS_API_KEY'));

$text = "TransformersPHP makes machine learning accessible for PHP developers...";
$summary = $client->summarize($text);

echo $summary;
```

### Capabilities
Text Summarization: Shorten lengthy content into concise summaries.
Language Translation: Translate text between multiple languages.
Text Classification: Detect sentiment, topics, or other attributes.
Image and Audio Processing: Depending on the libraryâ€™s capabilities.

### Laravel Integration
To simplify usage across your application:

Service Provider: Create a service provider for the client.
```php
php artisan make:provider TransformersServiceProvider
```

Register the client as a singleton:
```php
use TransformersPHP\Client;

public function register()
{
    $this->app->singleton(Client::class, function () {
        return new Client(env('TRANSFORMERS_API_KEY'));
    });
}
```

Facades (Optional): Create a facade for easier access:
```php
namespace App\Facades;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Facade;

class Transformers extends Facade
{
    protected static function getFacadeAccessor()
    {
        return \TransformersPHP\Client::class;
    }
}
```
Usage Example:
```php
use App\Facades\Transformers;

$result = Transformers::summarize($text);
```
