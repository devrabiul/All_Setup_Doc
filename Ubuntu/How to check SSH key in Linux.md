To check your SSH key in Linux, you can follow these steps:

#### 1. Locate the SSH Key Files
SSH keys are usually stored in the ~/.ssh directory in your home folder. To list the files in this directory, open a terminal and run:

```bash
ls -l ~/.ssh
```

This will list all the SSH key files, typically named id_rsa (private key) and id_rsa.pub (public key) for RSA keys. You might also see other key files such as id_ecdsa or id_ed25519 if different algorithms were used.

#### 2. View the SSH Public Key
To view your SSH public key, use the cat command:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

or, if you have a different key type:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
This command will display the content of your public key, which you can copy and use to add to services like GitHub, GitLab, or other servers.

#### 3. Check if the SSH Key is Loaded in the SSH Agent
To see if your SSH key is loaded in the SSH agent, use:

```bash
ssh-add -l
```

If your key is listed, it means it's loaded. If you see an error or no keys are listed, you may need to add your SSH key to the agent:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Or, if you're using a different key:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

#### 4. Generate a New SSH Key (if needed)
If you don't have an SSH key or need to generate a new one, you can do so with:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

This will create a new RSA key with a bit length of 4096. You can replace rsa with ed25519 for a different key type.

Follow the prompts to specify the file location and passphrase for additional security.

Summary
List SSH keys: ls -l ~/.ssh
View public key: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Check loaded keys in SSH agent: ssh-add -l
Generate a new SSH key: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
These steps will help you check and manage your SSH keys on a Linux system.
