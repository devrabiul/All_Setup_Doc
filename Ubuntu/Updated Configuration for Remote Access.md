The section of your configuration you’ve shared contains the settings related to phpMyAdmin. To resolve the "Access forbidden" issue, you'll need to modify the <Directory "/opt/lampp/phpmyadmin"> block.

#### Here’s how to proceed:

## Updated Configuration for Remote Access
Modify the <Directory> Block:

Replace the Require local line with Require all granted (for open access) or Require ip YOUR_IP_ADDRESS (to allow specific IPs only).
The updated block will look like this for unrestricted access:

```apache
<Directory "/opt/lampp/phpmyadmin">
    AllowOverride AuthConfig Limit
    Require all granted
    ErrorDocument 403 /error/XAMPP_FORBIDDEN.html.var
</Directory>
```

Or like this to allow specific IPs:
```apache
<Directory "/opt/lampp/phpmyadmin">
    AllowOverride AuthConfig Limit
    Require ip YOUR_IP_ADDRESS
    ErrorDocument 403 /error/XAMPP_FORBIDDEN.html.var
</Directory>
```

Save the Changes:

If using nano, press Ctrl + O to save, then press Enter. Exit with Ctrl + X.
Restart XAMPP:

Restart the XAMPP services to apply the changes:
```bash
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp restart
```
### Important Notes
#### Security Considerations:
Allowing unrestricted access with Require all granted poses significant security risks, especially if the server is accessible over the internet.
It’s recommended to restrict access to specific IP addresses or set up password authentication for sensitive resources like phpMyAdmin.
Alternative for Secure Remote Access:
Use a secure VPN or SSH tunneling to access phpMyAdmin remotely without exposing it to the public network.

#### Test Access
After making the changes, open phpMyAdmin in your browser. If configured correctly, it should now be accessible.
