Here’s a detailed and well-organized guide on how to fix the max_allowed_packet issue and increase the file upload limit in phpMyAdmin for XAMPP in Linux (Ubuntu):

1. Fixing the max_allowed_packet Issue in XAMPP (Linux)
When importing large SQL files or running queries that require more memory, you may encounter errors related to the max_allowed_packet size. To fix this, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Locate the my.cnf File
The my.cnf file is the MySQL configuration file used by XAMPP. On a Linux system, the file is located at:

```bash
/opt/lampp/etc/my.cnf
```

### Step 2: Edit the my.cnf File
Use a text editor such as nano to edit the my.cnf file:

```bash
sudo nano /opt/lampp/etc/my.cnf
```

### Step 3: Increase the max_allowed_packet Size
Look for the [mysqld] section in the my.cnf file. If it doesn't exist, add it. Then, add or modify the following line to increase the max_allowed_packet size to 64MB (you can adjust the size if needed):

```bash
[mysqld]
max_allowed_packet=64M
```

### Step 4: Save and Exit
Press CTRL + O to save the changes.
Press ENTER to confirm.
Press CTRL + X to exit the editor.

### Step 5: Restart MySQL (via XAMPP)
For the changes to take effect, restart the XAMPP services. This will restart MySQL along with other services:

```bash
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp restart
```

### Step 6: Verify the New Setting (Optional)
To verify that the new max_allowed_packet size has been applied, log into MySQL and run the following query:

```bash
/opt/lampp/bin/mysql -u root -p
```

After entering your MySQL password, execute this query:

```bash
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_allowed_packet';
```
This should return the new value (64M or whatever size you set).

2. Increasing the File Upload Limit in phpMyAdmin
To increase the file upload limit (such as the "Browse your computer: (Max: 40MiB)" message in phpMyAdmin), you need to adjust the PHP configuration files.

### Step 1: Locate and Edit the php.ini File
The php.ini file controls PHP settings, including file upload limits. For XAMPP on Linux, the file is located at:

```bash
/opt/lampp/etc/php.ini
```
Open the file for editing:

```bash
sudo nano /opt/lampp/etc/php.ini
```

### Step 2: Modify the File Upload Limits
Look for the following directives in the php.ini file and adjust them to increase the file size limit (for example, to 100MB):

```bash
upload_max_filesize = 100M
post_max_size = 100M
```
These two settings control:

upload_max_filesize: The maximum size of a file that can be uploaded.
post_max_size: The maximum size of a POST request (this must be equal to or larger than upload_max_filesize).

### Step 3: Edit the config.inc.php File in phpMyAdmin (Optional)
In some cases, phpMyAdmin’s configuration may also limit file uploads. You can adjust this by editing its configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /opt/lampp/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php
```
Ensure the following line exists (or add it if missing):

```bash
$cfg['UploadDir'] = '';
```

### Step 4: Restart XAMPP to Apply the Changes
After making changes to the php.ini and config.inc.php files, restart XAMPP:

```bash
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp restart
```

### Step 5: Verify in phpMyAdmin
Open phpMyAdmin in your web browser.

Check if the new file upload limit is displayed in the "Browse your computer" section.
Summary of Key Changes

max_allowed_packet increased to 64M in /opt/lampp/etc/my.cnf.
upload_max_filesize and post_max_size increased to 100M in /opt/lampp/etc/php.ini.

Restart XAMPP after changes to apply the new settings.
