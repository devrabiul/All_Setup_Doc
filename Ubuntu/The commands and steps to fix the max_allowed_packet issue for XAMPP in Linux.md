Here are all the commands and steps to fix the max_allowed_packet issue for XAMPP in Linux:

1. Locate the my.cnf file:
In XAMPP, the my.cnf configuration file is typically located in the following path:

```bash
/opt/lampp/etc/my.cnf
```

2. Edit the my.cnf file:
Use a text editor like nano to open and edit the file:

```bash
sudo nano /opt/lampp/etc/my.cnf
```

3. Increase max_allowed_packet:
In the [mysqld] section, add or modify the following line:

```bash
max_allowed_packet=64M
```

4. Save and exit:
After making changes, save the file by pressing CTRL + O, then press ENTER, and exit by pressing CTRL + X.

5. Restart MySQL through XAMPP:
Now, restart MySQL to apply the changes. You can do this by restarting XAMPP:

```bash
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp restart
```
This will restart all XAMPP services, including MySQL.

6. Verify the setting (optional):
You can log into MySQL and check if the setting has been applied:

```bash
/opt/lampp/bin/mysql -u root -p
```

After logging in, run the following query:

```bash
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_allowed_packet';
```

This should display the updated value (64M).
