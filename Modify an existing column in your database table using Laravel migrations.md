To modify an existing column in your database table using Laravel migrations, you'll need to use the Schema::table method along with the change method to make the email column nullable.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

Create a new migration: Run the following command to create a migration file:

```bash
php artisan make:migration modify_email_column_in_users_table --table=users
```

Modify the migration file: Open the newly created migration file located in the database/migrations directory. Update the up and down methods to make the email column nullable.

```bash
<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

class ModifyEmailColumnInUsersTable extends Migration
{
    /**
     * Run the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->string('email')->nullable()->change();
        });
    }

    /**
     * Reverse the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function down()
    {
        Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->string('email')->nullable(false)->change();
        });
    }
}
```

Run the migration: After saving the migration file, run the following command to apply the migration:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This will make the email column in the users table nullable. If you ever need to revert this change, you can run the php artisan migrate:rollback command, which will run the down method of your migration file and revert the column to its previous state.
