### Next.js project with Vite

To set up a Next.js project with Vite, you'll need to follow these steps:

Create a Next.js project: If you haven't already installed Next.js, you can do so using npm or yarn. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs-app
```

Replace my-nextjs-app with the name of your project.

Install Vite plugin for Next.js: Next.js has a Vite plugin that allows you to use Vite as the development server. Install it by running:

```bash
npm install --save-dev next-plugin-vite
```

or

```bash
yarn add --dev next-plugin-vite
```

Configure Next.js to use Vite: Create or modify your next.config.js file in the root of your Next.js project, and add the following configuration:

```bash
// next.config.js
const withVite = require('next-plugin-vite');

module.exports = withVite({
  vite: {
    // Vite options
  },
});
```

Start the development server: Now you can start the development server with Vite by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start your Next.js project using Vite as the development server.

That's it! You've set up a Next.js project with Vite. You can now develop your application as usual, and Vite will handle the fast development server and hot module replacement.
